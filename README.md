Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- The goal of this application is to have a database of your esports players (coming from the perspective of a esports captain.)
- A lot, I had to rename stuff to gamertag, the database I had a hassle on envisioning how I'd set it up and how'd I would create a "relation". I struggled with a lot of small bugs... but I spent a few days googling and rewriting code to make sure things sailed smoothly. 
- Currently at the moment, I use cookies as authorization and I didn't implement OAuth.
- I used the water css framework because I love the simplistic blue tones that it gave my login page. It reminded me of my darker purple tones I had previously.
  - The only modifications I made at this point was just some padding and flexbox adjustments. 
- The middle wares I used were GET/Delete/Post/Edit/Use where they essentially did as their name implies. They define a route where I can send submit/get/delete/etc to my client and allow me to have a place to have mongoDB perform those actions. I've also added a root URL handler to direct my page to my login rather than my index.html. As well as POST for my login and registration calls.
